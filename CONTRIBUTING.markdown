Contributing
============

Please read before contributing.

git etiquette
-------------

Before contributing it will be wise to read the [gitlab instructions](doc/GitLab_instructions.pdf).

Before making a commit, run `git status` and make sure you are not adding any large files (>10MB) unless absolutely necessary. Fix the issue and rebase in your local repository before running `git push` as commits stay in history.

Code of Conduct
---------------

We follow the [University's Code of Conduct](https://president.umich.edu/committees/presidents-advisory-committee-on-labor-standards-and-human-rights/code-of-conduct/) written by The Office of the President.
