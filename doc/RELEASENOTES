Known issues with the release of the University of Michigan
Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) and its constituent components.

SWMF core:
	1. The SC component can now use the corotating HGR frame.
	   The SC/IH coupling is tested, but the SC/SP and IH/SC
           couplings do not work for this case yet. 

        NOTE: All couplings work if SC is in the HGI frame.

RB/RiceV5:
        1. The Radiation Belt (RB) module included with this release
           does not conform to several SWMF requirements for physics
           modules.  These include:
                A. The module does not write or read restart files.
                B. The time-step taken by the module cannot be
                   controlled (reduced) by the control module (CON). 

        2. Plotting and analysis tools for examining RB output are not
           included with the distribution.

        3. The RB module is quite sensitive to complier options,
           especially optimization settings.

UA/GITM:
        1. Although the UA/GITM model can restart from a known 
           steady-state, its initial output depends on its coupling 
           with IE.  Therefore UA results, even on restart from a 
           steady-state, tend to lack fidelity for the first several 
           couplings with the IE module.  Results from UA should be
           ignored during this period.

	NOTE: the UA/GITM2 model restarts correctly.

UA/GITM2:
	1. The new version 2 of GITM has not been tested on all platforms.
	   Succesful test runs were made with 
           SGI Altix/Intel ifort8.070, Linux/NAG f95, and Linux/pgf90.

IM/RCM:
        1. Restarting the RCM (IM module) requires that if both restart
           files and plot files were written that both files must exist
           in order to restart.  This is due to the fact that when RCM
           writes plot and restart files, it appends them to files that
           are assumed to exist already via a record number.  This is
           not a bug, but the behavior does seem somewhat counter
           intuitive and may need modification.
	NOTE: The plotting output is being completely redesigned 
              to address this.

GM, IH, SC  / BATSRUS:
        1. Automatic Mesh Refinement (AMR) on restart does not hold the
           blocks touching the body to a constant refinement level
           when told to do so.  The feature works within a run
           correctly but fails to perform correctly after a restart.

	FIXED: 09/24/2005 G. Toth

        2. The user_routine structure seems to require a reformulation
           in order to avoid incompatibilities of the different
           routines and flags.

SP/Kota:
        1. The SEP module included with this release does not have the
           ability to restart.

           NOTE: One can save the MHD data needed by this model into files
                 and the SP/Kota model can be (re)run continuously
                 by itself.

        2. The shock sensing algorithm used in the SEP module is not 
           robust enough to find the correct shock structure in all
           situations.
