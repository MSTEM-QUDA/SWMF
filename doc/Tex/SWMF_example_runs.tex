The examples in this chapter are intended to make you familiar
with the use of the SWMF. By carefully following the steps you should
be able to do the tests as described. It is a good idea to read the
provided PARAM.in files and try to understand how
the examples work. You may also experiment by changing these files
after copied from the originals. These examples should help you
in setting up your own runs.

For sake of simplicity we describe how to do all the example runs with the
same executable. In actual runs one would streamline the configuration
of the SWMF to reduce compilation time and memory use. If you work
on a machine with limited resources, you may wish to configure SWMF
differently. For example, you may set the Empty version for the unused
components. If the number of processors is limited, you will have to
change the \#COMPONENTMAP command in PARAM.in and overlap the components. You may also have to 
increase the allowed grid size per processor, or you can run the problem with 
a coarser grid resolution. To reduce the CPU time, you may shorten the 
run by changing the number of iterations or the final time in the 
PARAM.in file.

\section{Configuration and Compilation for the Examples}

Select the SC/BATSRUS component version. When this is done the first time
after installation, the SC/BATSRUS source code is created from the GM/BATSRUS
source code, which takes a few minutes:
\begin{verbatim}
Config.pl -v=SC/BATSRUS -g=SC:4,4,4,1000
\end{verbatim}
Set the grid size for the GM/BATSRUS and IH/BATSRUS\_share components:
\begin{verbatim}
Config.pl -g=GM:8,8,8,200,40
\end{verbatim}
You can select either the UA/GITM version with
\begin{verbatim}
Config.pl -v=UA/GITM -g=UA:9,9,25,2,2
\end{verbatim}
or the new (default) UA/GITM2 version with
\begin{verbatim}
Config.pl -v=UA/GITM2 -g=UA:9,9,25,4
\end{verbatim}
Note the difference in the grid size parameters.
You should also take care of using the parameter files appropriate for
the selected UA component version.  GITM2 is the default UA module
currently in the SWMF and is the most up to date.

Check the current settings with
\begin{verbatim}
Config.pl -show
\end{verbatim}
You should see the current directory, the operating system, the name
of the compiler and the following settings
\begin{verbatim}
The default precision for reals is double precision.
The selected component versions and grid sizes are:
GM/BATSRUS                   grid: 8,8,8,200,40
IE/Ridley_serial             
IH/BATSRUS                   grid: 8,8,8,200,40
IM/RCM                       
RB/RiceV5                    
SC/BATSRUS                   grid: 4,4,4,1000
SP/Kota                      grid: 1000,10,150
UA/GITM2                     grid: 9,9,25,4
\end{verbatim}
In case you selected the UA/GITM version, the last line will read
\begin{verbatim}
UA/GITM                      grid: 9,9,25,2,2
\end{verbatim}
If the settings differ you can change them with the Config.pl script.

Compile the main executable code bin/SWMF.exe. With the above
settings this may take a while, but if you select Empty versions
for the unused components, it will take much less.
The -j flag is used to do the compilation in parallel on multiple
cores, which speeds up things a lot.
You should also compile the post processing code bin/PostIDL.exe,
and finally create a run directory and change to that directory
\begin{verbatim}
make -j
make PIDL
make rundir
cd run
\end{verbatim}
Note that the run directory contains subdirectories for all the
non-empty components. There is also a link to the Param directory
in the main SWMF directory. The Param directory contains all the
parameter and layout files used in the example runs.

\section{Example 1: Create Steady State for the Solar Corona}

This example involves the SC component only. It demonstrates
how a steady state solar corona can be obtained from
a magnetogram. The convergence to steady state is accelerated by 
a gradual grid refinement and a gradual application of the
more-and-more accurate numerical schemes. The final state
is a steady state to high accuracy. 

You can use the SWMF with the settings recommended above
but you only need the SC component and
all other component versions can be Empty.

Copy the PARAM.in file
\begin{verbatim}
rm -f PARAM.in
cp Param/PARAM.in.test.start.SCIH PARAM.in
\end{verbatim}

Check the parameter file with the TestParam.pl script. 
This script should be run from the main directory.
Define the number of CPU-s you plan to use with the -n=NUMBER flag.
For example
\begin{verbatim}
cd ..
Scripts/TestParam.pl -n=32
\end{verbatim}
The script should return without any warnings and error messages.
If there are error messages, fix them. 
For example if the grid is not large enough there will be an 
error message from the command \#CHECKGRIDSIZE with respect
to the parameter  MinBlockALL, which contains the minimum number
of blocks required. To fix the problem, you have to increase the number 
of CPU-s or increase the grid size for the SC component with the 
Config.pl script. For example set
\begin{verbatim}
Config.pl -g=SC:4,4,4,1500,1
\end{verbatim}
Keep fixing the problems until the Scripts/TestParam.pl runs silently.
Remember to recompile SWMF.exe if you change the block size, the first
three numbers. The number of explicit and implicit blocks (the fourth
and fifth numbers) can be changed during run time in the PARAM.in file.

Run the code by submitting a job or do it interactively
\begin{verbatim}
cd run
mpiexec -n 32 SWMF.exe | tee runlog.SC
\end{verbatim}
Here 'tee' is a Unix command which splits the output to the screen as
well as pipes it to the file 'runlog.SC'. 

Depending on the number of processors and the speed of the machine,
this run should take a few to several hours to complete.
You may check the progress on the screen, or look at the 
runlog.SC file, or look at the log file written by the code
\begin{verbatim}
tail SC/IO2/log*
\end{verbatim}
This file contains information determined by the \#SAVELOGFILE command
in the PARAM.in file. In this case the file contains the time step, the
time (which is zero, because this is a steady state run) and the
magnetic, kinetic and thermal energies integrated over the surface of 
two spheres of radii 4 and 10. As the code approaches steady state,
the integrated energies will change less and less. 

When the run finishes successfully (or even while the code is running), 
you can postprocess the plot files
\begin{verbatim}
./PostProc.pl
\end{verbatim}
If the machine does not have the 'preplot' code
installed (preplot is a script that comes with the Tecplot software),
you can gzip the .dat files to save disk space and transfer time
\begin{verbatim}
./PostProc.pl -g
\end{verbatim}
You can visualize the output files in run/SC/IO2 with your favored 
visualization software. For visualization with IDL you should read the
chapter on ``IDL visualization'' in the user manual in GM/BATSRUS/Doc.

Use the Restart.pl script to create and link as input a restart tree, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
Restart.pl RESTART_SC
\end{verbatim}

\section{Example 2: Create SC-IH Steady State}

This example run is built on the previous example. We restart SC from the
steady state created in the previous run and start the IH component from 
scratch and run the two components coupled until the IH component reaches
a steady state. 

First copy in the prepared parameter file
\begin{verbatim}
rm -f PARAM.in
cp Param/PARAM.in.test.restart.SCIH  PARAM.in
\end{verbatim}
Look at the PARAM.in file to see how the convergence to 
steady state is accelerated.
First of all the SC component only provides the boundary conditions for IH,
so it only runs in every 100th iteration (see the \#CYCLE command in
the PARAM.in file). Second, the IH grid is built
up with a gradual grid refinement, and third the 
more-and-more accurate and expensive numerical schemes are 
applied in an optimal sequence. The final state
is a steady state for SC and IH to high accuracy. 

You can use the SWMF with the settings recommended for all the examples,
but you only need the SC and IH components so 
all other component versions can be Empty.

As usual, check the input parameters and the layout for the
number of CPU-s you plan to use, for example
\begin{verbatim}
cd ..
Scripts/TestParam.pl -n=32
\end{verbatim}
If there are error messages, fix them until the script runs silently.

Run the code by submitting a job, or interactively
\begin{verbatim}
cd run
mpiexec -n 32 SWMF.exe | tee runlog.SCIH
\end{verbatim}
When the run finishes, postprocess the plot files for both components
and put the results into the RESULTS/run1 directory
\begin{verbatim}
./PostProc.pl RESULTS/run1
\end{verbatim}
This will also store the restart files, both for SC and IH, into
RESULTS/run1/RESTART/, which can be used in a future run after linking
it as input
\begin{verbatim}
./Restart.pl -i RESULTS/run1/RESTART
\end{verbatim}

\section{Example 3: Create Initial Conditions for the Global Magnetosphere}

This example involves the GM component only. It demonstrates
how a reasonable global magnetosphere can be obtained.
The upwind boundary conditions are based on the solution obtained
for the IH component in the 2nd example run, but they
are intentionally modified to contain a discontinuity.
This is for demonstration purposes only to make a subsequent
GM-IH coupled run more dynamic. In a more typical run one would
use the upwind boundary condition based on satellite measurements 
or by coupling to the IH code.

The convergence to steady state is accelerated by 
a gradual grid refinement, and a gradual application of the
more-and-more accurate numerical schemes. The final state
is a reasonable global magnetosphere solution, but it is not 
a perfect steady state (that would require many more iterations).

First copy in the prepared parameter and layout files and check them
\begin{verbatim}
rm -f PARAM.in
cp Param/PARAM.in.test.start.GM  PARAM.in
\end{verbatim}
The parameters of the \#SOLARWIND command were obtained
from the result of the SC-IH steady state. 
Otherwise this test can be run independently, 
no restart files are read.
You can use the SWMF with the settings recommended for all the tests, 
but you only need the GM component, so all other component versions 
can be set to Empty.

Check the parameters and layout before running the SWMF
\begin{verbatim}
cd ..
Scripts/TestParam.pl -n=16
\end{verbatim}
If there are error messages, fix them until the script reports no errors.
Run the code by submitting a job, or interactively
\begin{verbatim}
cd run
mpiexec -n 16 SWMF.exe | tee runlog.GM
\end{verbatim}
Postprocess the plot files into the RESULTS directory and link the restart files
for a future run:
\begin{verbatim}
./PostProc.pl RESULTS/run2
./Restart.pl -i RESULTS/run2/RESTART
\end{verbatim}

\section{Example 4: Create Initial Conditions for the GM, IM, IE 
         and UA Components}

This example involves the GM, IM, IE and UA components. It demonstrates
how to obtain a reasonable solution for the 
coupled global/inner magnetosphere, ionosphere and upper atmosphere.
The initial global magnetosphere solution is taken from Example 3.

Copy the layout file into the run directory
\begin{verbatim}
rm -f PARAM.in
cp Param/PARAM.in.test.restart.GMIMIEUA PARAM.in
\end{verbatim}
Have a look at the new PARAM.in file.
The convergence to steady state is accelerated by component subcycling
(see the \#CYCLE commands in PARAM.in).
The components are called at different frequencies, which
allows the components to reach a reasonable solution
approximately at the same rate. Another optimization trick is the changing of 
the coupling order such that the IE component sends information before
it would receive it (see the \#COUPLEORDER command in PARAM.in),
so that IE component can solve for the electric potential concurrently with the
other components running. To reduce the time spent on field line
tracing, which is needed for the IM to GM coupling, the \#RAYTRACE command
in the GM section limits the frequency of traces to every 80th iteration.

Now have a look at the component layout:
\begin{verbatim}
#COMPONENTMAP
UA   0    31    1
IM   32   32    1
IE   33   34    1
GM   35  999    1
\end{verbatim}
As you can see all the components are running concurrently.
Unless you have access to at least 64 processors, 
you probably want to modify the layout file.
For example for 32 processors you can overlap the UA component 
with the other components and run IE on a single processor:
\begin{verbatim}
#COMPONENTMAP
UA    0   31    1
IE    0    0    1
IM    1    1    1
GM    2   31    1
\end{verbatim}
You can use the SWMF with the settings recommended for all the tests, 
but you only need the GM, IM, IE and UA components,
all other component versions can be Empty.

Check the parameters and layout for the number of processors you plan to use
\begin{verbatim}
cd ..
Scripts/TestParam.pl -n=32
\end{verbatim}
If there are error messages, fix them. 
Run the code by submitting a job, or interactively
\begin{verbatim}
cd run
mpiexec -n 32 SWMF.exe | tee runlog.GMIMIEUA
\end{verbatim}
This run should take an hour or so on 32 processors.
After the run postprocess the plot files
\begin{verbatim}
./PostProc.pl
\end{verbatim}
You can use the RESTART.pl script to create a restart tree, for example
\begin{verbatim}
Restart.pl -o RESTART_GMIMIEUA
\end{verbatim}

\section{Example 5: Time Accurate Run with SC, IH and SP Components}

This example involves the Solar Corona, Inner Heliosphere
and Solar Energetic Particles components.
The run starts from a steady state of the SC and IH components
which was obtained in Example 2.

Copy in the prepared parameter and layout files
\begin{verbatim}
rm -f PARAM.in
cp Param/PARAM.in.test.restart.SCIHSP PARAM.in
\end{verbatim}
At the beginning of this time accurate run a CME is 
generated in the SC component. This demonstrates the
use of an Eruptive Event generator.
The SP component is coupled, and during the 4-hour evolution
of the CME, substantial particle acceleration is observed. 
By the end of the run the CME reaches the boundary 
between the SC and IH components, and partially enters the IH domain.
The test demonstrates the coupling between the SC-IH and SP
components in a challenging simulation.

In case you have limited computational resources, you can 
shorten the run by editing the PARAM.in file and changing
the \#STOP command at the end of the file. For example 
\begin{verbatim}
#STOP
-1                     MaxIteration
1800.0                 tSimulationMax
\end{verbatim}
will reduce the final simulation time to 30 minutes.

Also have a look at the layout:
\begin{verbatim}
#COMPONENTMAP
SP    0   0    1 
SC    1  -1    1
IH    1  -1    1
\end{verbatim}
The SC and IH components are overlapped while the SP component
runs concurrently. This is probably the optimal layout for any
number of CPU-s.

You can use the SWMF with the settings for all the tests, 
but you only need the SC, IH and SP components,
all other component versions can be Empty.

Check the parameters and layout before running the SWMF
\begin{verbatim}
cd ..
Scripts/TestParam.pl -n=32
\end{verbatim}
If there are error messages, fix them, then run the SWMF by submitting a job
or interactively
\begin{verbatim}
cd run
mpiexec -n 32 SWMF.exe | tee runlog.SCIHSP
\end{verbatim}
This run may take a long time if run all the way to 4 hours.
After the run finishes, postprocess the plot files
\begin{verbatim}
./PostProc.pl
\end{verbatim}
The restart files can be collected into a restart tree 
with the Restart.pl script. For the full 4 hour run you could use
\begin{verbatim}
Restart.pl -o RESTART_SCIHSP_4hr
\end{verbatim}
