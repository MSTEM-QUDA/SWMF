We have developed a set of logos to represent the Space Weather
Modeling Framework (SWMF). The logo was designed by Matthew Sturm
graphics designer.

It is appropriate to use the SWMF logo to indicate work which uses the
SWMF code, its components or results derived from the SWMF.  When
using the logo you should indicate the extent to which members of the
SWMF development team has been involved in your project.

The SWMF logos provided in this distribution are copyrighted and
should not be modified in any way.
