We have developed a set of logos to represent the Space Weather
Modeling Framework (SWMF) which is a product of the Center for Space
Environment Modeling (CSEM) at the University of Michigan.  It is
appropriate to use the SWMF logo to indicate work which uses the SWMF
code, its components or results derived from the SWMF.  When using the
logo you should indicate the extent to which members of the SWMF
development team and CSEM have been involved in your project.  

Use of the CSEM logo implies that results derived from the SWMF carry
the endorsement of CSEM scientists.  Therefore, the CSEM logo is
appropriate to use only for close collaboration with scientists at
CSEM. Use of the CSEM logo should indicate the direct involvement of a
CSEM scientist in the research being presented.  In addition, use of
the logo may imply code development which is done by, or in close
collaboration with, CSEM scientists.

The SWMF and CSEM logos provided in this distribution are copyright and
should not be modified in anyway.
