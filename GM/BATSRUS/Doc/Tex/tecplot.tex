\section{Tecplot Visualization \label{section:tecplot_visualization}}

Tecplot is a visualization package created by Amtec Engineering, Inc.
out of Bellevue, Washington.  The package was originally designed for
visualization of the output of computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
codes and now is a good multipurpose visualization package.  
The strengths of Tecplot are the point and click interface, the 
wide range of options and the ability to produce high quality
three dimensional images in postscript, encapsulated postscript, tiff
and other formats.  The package comes with detailed
documentation for processing data and creating images.
This is perhaps the best place to get information about visualizing
the data using Tecplot.
