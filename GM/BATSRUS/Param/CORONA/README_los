STEREO A (EUVI-A)
STEREO B (EUVI-B)
------------------------
Position files should be in HGI Coordinates, 
!!!!NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Time as set in PARAM.in
file should coinside with the 
!!!!OBSERVATION TIME!!!!!!!!
Otherwise, the observer position will be wrong.
------------------------
To take the Earth coordinates in HGI, one should manually modify 

  Param/HELIOSPHERE/Earth_Traj.in

file: put there the desired date/time, change coordinate system to 
HGI and reduce time interval for output (0.0  0.0  10.0). You can do this
in the Param/HELIOSPHERE directory or in any other place you want

Then in the root directory of BATSRUS do

  make EARTH_TRAJ

Then in the Param/HEIOSPHERE directory of BATSRUS or in any other directory
where we put the modified EARTH_TRAJ.in do

PATH_TO_SWMF/SWMF/bin/EARTH_TRAJ.exe  

three coordinates of the Earth position in HGI will be printed at your screen 
(the very last three reals), already normalized by R_sun. Put these three 
coordinates to the current file as
	      
FirstNumber          xPos(Earth)
SeconndNumber        yPos(Earth)
ThirdNumber          zPos(Earth)

To download the orbit for STEREO A use

wget ftp://mussel.srl.caltech.edu/pub/stereo/Position/ahead//position_ahead_2011_HCI.txt

For STEREO B use

wget ftp://mussel.srl.caltech.edu/pub/stereo/Position/behind/position_behind_2011_HCI.txt

these commands are for the year 2011, the change for another year (late 2006 and later)
is evident. 

The positions of the satellite (three last numbers in each line) should be found for the 
day-of-year as determined from Month/day (year, if it is a leap one) and the second-of-day
which is hour*3600+minute*60+second. The flag (0/1) going after year/day/second should be ignored

The three coordinares in km should be normalized by R_sun.
To achieve this, the data should be divided by 696000 (km)

The obtained numbers should be put into a current file as

1. For Stereo A ("ahead")

FirstNumber(DividedBy696000)          xPos(STEREO A)
SeconndNumber(DividedBy696000)        yPos(STEREO A)     
ThirdNumber(DividedBy696000)          zPos(STEREO A)

2. For Stereo B ("behind")

FirstNumber(DividedBy696000)          xPos(STEREO B)
SeconndNumber(DividedBy696000)        yPos(STEREO B)     
ThirdNumber(DividedBy696000)          zPos(STEREO B)


The current file is for 2011/03/07 UT20:00 
(year=2011, day-of-year=66, second-of-day=72000)
It is assumed that SC component simulates the
close proximity of the Sun (if LC does, you should
modify the file names).
