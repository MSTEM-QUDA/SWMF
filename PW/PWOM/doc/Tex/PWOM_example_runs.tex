In this chapter we will provide some examples of how to actually use the 
PWOM. After reading this chapter you should be familiar enough with the 
use of the model to setup your own simple runs. Three standalone examples are 
provided: 
Two for Earth and one for Saturn. The tests will require two separate 
configurations and compilations. One for each planet.

Additionally one example of using the PWOM as the PW component of the SWMF 
is provided. This example assumes that you already have the SWMF installed.
