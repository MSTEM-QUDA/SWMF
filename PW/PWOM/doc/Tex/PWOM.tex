The content of this chapter is generated from the Param/PARAM.XML file.
The XML file can be read with an editor and can be used
for creating PARAM.in files by copying small parts from them.

The transformation of the XML
format into LaTex is done with the share/Scripts/XmlToTex.pl
script. This script generates index terms for all commands,
which are used to create an alphabetical index at the end of this chapter.
